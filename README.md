# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview

This analysis evaluates the academic performance of schools in a fictional district using budget, school type, and size metrics. By merging school-level and student-level datasets, key insights were drawn about the relationship between spending, school size, and performance.

## Key Findings

- Schools with **higher per-student spending ($645â€“$675)** tended to **underperform** compared to those with smaller budgets ($585 or less).
- **Smaller and medium-sized schools** consistently outperformed large schools in math performance, with pass rates around **89â€“91%** versus **67%** in larger schools.
- **Charter schools** outperformed **district public schools** across all metrics, but further analysis is needed to determine if this is due to operational differences or smaller average enrollments.

## Project Structure

- `Resources/`: Contains the original CSV data files:
  - `schools_complete.csv`
  - `students_complete.csv`
- `PyCitySchools.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with all data processing and analysis steps.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Pathlib** for file path handling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## Data Preparation

Data was read and combined using:

```python
school_data = pd.read_csv("Resources/schools_complete.csv")
student_data = pd.read_csv("Resources/students_complete.csv")
school_data_complete = pd.merge(student_data, school_data, how="left", on="school_name")
```

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights systemic trends in the PyCity School District:
- Higher spending does not correlate with better academic performance.
- Smaller and medium schools consistently achieve higher pass rates.
- Charter schools excel across all major academic indicators.
